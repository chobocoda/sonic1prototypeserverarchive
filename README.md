# sonic1prototypeserverarchive
Archive of all the contents of the Sonic 1 Prototype Server.

6th August 2021, stupid decisions by the creator, I've left the server and made this private. This is what they get for ruining the server.


On July 27th 2021, MrLordSith deleted the Sonic 1 Prototype Server. The same day, a group of people attempted to preserve all information that was lost (in the deletion) in the server.

You can join the server at: https://discord.gg/gNk3Mayu8q , and help us preserve all information that was lost.
