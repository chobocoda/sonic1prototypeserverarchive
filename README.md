# Sith's Sonic 1 Prototype Server - Attachments Archive

Archive of all the contents of the Sonic 1 Prototype Server.

Thank you MrLordSith for destroying over 3/4 years of content.
Despite you being a "preservationist", you've done something which well.. isn't really good for preservation.
Unfortunately we were unable to get all attachments, as they have now been removed by Discord.

Again, thanks Sith for ruining a server which I and many others have spent hours on for it to all go away.

(Next time, try privating your server rather than deleting it).
